## Health Emergency BC, February 2022

### Overview
This project, undertaken for Health Emergency BC in February 2022, involved a collaborative effort to address the challenge of efficiently managing emergency codes. Our solution involved the development and deployment of a web-based form, leveraging modern web technologies. This repository contains the documentation and resources related to the project.

### Project Description
#### Context and Challenge
Health Emergency BC faced a critical challenge in managing emergency codes, primarily due to reliance on outdated methods involving Microsoft Outlook. This process was inefficient and lacked the necessary agility for rapid and accurate emergency code dissemination.

#### Objective
Our primary goal was to create a more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly system for managing emergency codes, replacing the outdated Outlook-based process.

### Solution
#### Web Form Development
We developed a web form using the following technologies:
- **HTML**: Structured the content and layout of the form.
- **CSS**: Styled the form for a user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced form interactivity, including validation and dynamic content adjustments.

#### Deployment
The form was deployed on a `form.io` server, ensuring a robust and scalable solution. This deployment strategy allowed for high availability and ease of access for users across BC.

#### Features
- **User Submission**: Users can fill in the form through a web interface.
- **PDF Generation**: Upon submission, the form data is converted into a PDF format.
- **Email Integration**: The generated PDF is automatically attached and sent via email, ensuring timely delivery of emergency codes.

### Impact
- **Efficiency**: The web form significantly improved the process of submitting and managing emergency codes.
- **Accessibility**: Users can access the form from any device with internet connectivity, enhancing the reach and reliability of the emergency code system.
- **Data Management**: The digital format of the form made data collection and analysis more straightforward, providing valuable insights for future improvements.

### Limitations
Due to company policies, the source code for this project cannot be shared publicly. However, this documentation provides an overview of the project's scope, technologies used, and the impact it had on improving the emergency code management system for Health Emergency BC.

### Future Work
In the next iterations, we planed to introduce additional features such as real-time updates to emergency codes and integration with other emergency response systems.
